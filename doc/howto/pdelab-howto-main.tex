\begin{abstract}
This article contains concepts for a general discretization module for
the ``Distributed Numerics Environment'' (DUNE). It should enable one
to build up a library of finite element methods in an easy and
extendable way that is closely related to the mathematical formulation
of finite element method. As the first necessary step an abstract
framework for formulating a large variety of finite element methods is
attempted.

\subsection{What is missing in DUNE?}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle<presentation>{What is missing in DUNE?}
\begin{itemize}
\item FEM Framework. Define grid based discretization schemes for
arbitrary systems of PDEs in an easy way that allows one to exploit
all the features of DUNE.
\item Coupling of problems on different grids (overlapping and
non-overlapping, different dimension). Includes parallelization and
mapping of grids to parts of a parallel machine.
\item Robust solvers for coupled problems that are as general as
possible. 
\item Fast, robust and scalable grid manager for locally refined
unstructured grids.
\item Geometry module and CAD interface allowing definition of domains, coefficients and
boundary conditions independent of a  specific grid
manager. Integration in Salome framework?
\item HDF based persistent storage of meshes and functions. Scalable
to large data sets and read/write from many grid managers.
\item Workflow environment. High-level description of simulation
workflows. 
\end{itemize}
