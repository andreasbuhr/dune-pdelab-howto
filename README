PDELab Howto ============

PDELab is a PDE solver toolbox built on top of DUNE, the Distributed and Unified
Numerics Environment [0].

The main intention is to provide a good set of high-level abstractions to allow
for a reasonably quick development of simulation codes, while at the same time
offering the flexibility to implement new numerical methods and optimize for
specific simulation scenarios.

This package contains PDELab examples and and introduction. The actual library
is contained in the package dune-pdelab.

Dependencies ------------

PDELab-Howto depends on the following software packages:

* DUNE core libraries (dune-common, dune-geometry, dune-grid, dune-istl,
  dune-localfunctions) version 2.2.x, and their respective dependencies.

* PDELab 1.0 and its dependencies.

* PDELab's compiler requirements differ slightly from the underlying DUNE
  libraries: We require at least GCC 4.0, although we only regurlarly test GCC
  versions from GCC 4.2 onward. Compile times are greatly reduced if the
  compiler supports the new C++11 standard (GCC 4.3 and newer). PDELab is not
  regularly tested with ICC, but we also support the clang compiler (3.1+).

For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read the
installation notes [1].

Installation ------------

Short installation instructions can be found in file INSTALL. For the full
instructions please see [1].
