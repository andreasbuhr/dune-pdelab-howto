PDELab Howto 1.0
================

This is the 1.1 release of PDELab, a PDE discretization toolkit built
on top of the DUNE framework [0]. License information can be found in the file
COPYING.

PDELab 1.1 is a minor feature release mostly focused on fixing bugs, but it also
includes a number of new features. For details, see the changelog below.

If you need help, please ask on our mailinglist [1]. Bugs can also be submitted
to the PDELab bugtracker at [2] instead.

This release of PDELab is designed to work with the 2.2 release of the DUNE
libraries.

The dune-pdelab-howto package only contains example programs. You also need the
actual library package dune-pdelab.


Changes
=======

PDELab 1.1
----------

This is the first release of PDELab after the move from Subversion to Git for
version control. You CANNOT find this release on the Subversion server. If you prefer
to directly check out the sources instead of using the provided tarballs, please see
our website for information on how to access the Git repository.

- The directory src/boilerplatetutorial contains a number of examples using the new
  boilerplate infrastructure layer from PDELab that is designed to reduce the amount
  of code required for writing standard PDELab programs.

- New example convection-diffusion/tutorial that also showcases the boilerplate
  infrastructure.

- We fixed most of the deprecation warnings due to deprecated APIs in the core modules.

- Fix for builds from repository with recent versions of autotools.

- Several bug fixes.

  - PDELab 1.1.0
    - Fix for cgstokes benchmark breaking the build if UG is not installed
    - Adaptivity example ported to new adaptivity infrastructure
    - Several updates to Howto text

  - PDELab 1.1-rc2
    - fix for compilation problem with boilerplate examples
    - build tarballs using GNU tar and make sure they work without automake installed

  - PDELab 1.1-rc1
    - initial release candidate

Caveats
=======

The following list is a non-exhaustive overview of possible problems you might
encounter with this release. This only lists problems specific to the
Howto. Please take a look at the release notes of dune-pdelab for issues
regarding the actual library.

Stokes
--------

* The cgstokes_instat example is currently broken (it does not even compile)
  and has been removed from the build process.

General
-------

* Compile times can be really long for non-trivial problems. Some developers
  have had good success with using the clang compiler instead of GCC during
  development and bug-testing to reduce compile times.

* If you are still using a *really* ancient version of PDELab, have a look at
  doc/README.changes for an overview of the major API changes that might keep
  your code from compiling.
