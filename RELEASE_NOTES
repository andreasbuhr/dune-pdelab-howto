PDELab Howto 1.0.0
==================

This is the first public release of PDELab, a PDE discretization toolkit built
on top of the DUNE framework [0]. License information can be found in the file
COPYING.

If you need help, please ask on our mailinglist [1]. Bugs can also be submitted
to the PDELab bugtracker at [2] instead.

This release of PDELab is designed to work with the 2.2 release of the DUNE
libraries.

The dune-pdelab-howto package only contains example programs. You also need the
actual library package dune-pdelab.


Caveats
=======

The following list is a non-exhaustive overview of possible problems you might
encounter with this release. This only lists problems specific to the
Howto. Please take a look at the release notes of dune-pdelab for issues
regarding the actual library.

Stokes
--------

* The cgstokes_instat example is currently broken (it does not even compile)
  and has been removed from the build process.

General
-------

* Compile times can be really long for non-trivial problems. Some developers
  have had good success with using the clang compiler instead of GCC during
  development and bug-testing to reduce compile times.

* If you are still using a *really* ancient version of PDELab, have a look at
  doc/README.changes for an overview of the major API changes that might keep
  your code from compiling.
